.left-column[
## Diagnosis
]
.right-column[
- Diagnosis can be especially challenging due to:
  - Lack of patient recognition that their symptoms are linked to a previous traumatic experience
  - Patient unwillingness to discuss the traumatic experience to others
  - Patient's symptoms are masked by the symptoms of comorbid conditions, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, or other mental health conditions

- Typically characterized by intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, hypervigilance/anxiety, and sleep disturbances

- Can also occur as the following subtypes:
  - With dissociative symptoms
  - With delayed expression (approximately 25% of patients experience symptoms > 6 months after the trauma)

## Epidemiology

]
.right-column[
- Lifetime prevalence: 6.8-12.3% of the United States population .red[<sup>1</sup>]

- Women are four times more likely to develop PTSD than men .red[<sup>2</sup>]

- Sexual assault is the most frequent form of trauma that results in PTSD among women .red[<sup>1</sup>]

- Individuals who have been previously victimized are more likely to be victimized again; thus, the risk for PTSD increases

.left-column[
## Comorbidity
]
.right-column[
- The National Comorbidity Survey .red[<sup>3</sup>] from 1990 suggested that:
  - 16% of all patients with PTSD have **one** comorbid psychiatric disorder
  - 17% of all patients with PTSD have **two** comorbid psychiatric disorders
  - 50% of all patients with PTSD have **three or more** comorbid psychiatric disorders

- Some studies have shown that somatization disorders are 90 times more likely to occur in PTSD patients than in those without PTSD .red[<sup>4</sup>]

- Affective (usually depressive) disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are 2-4 times more common in PTSD patients than in the general population

.left-column[
## Treatment Approaches
]
.right-column[
- Multifocal nature of PTSD requires a treatment approach that involves patient education, social support, psychotherapy, and pharmacologic intervention .red[<sup>5</sup>]

- Patient education and social support play a critical role in the short term after the trauma/diagnosis of PTSD in order to decrease a patient's sense of survivor guilt or stigmatization associated with the trauma

- Psychotherapy, specifically Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT), is the primary mode of psychotherapy that has been utilized successfully in patients with PTSD
  - Highest dropout rates result from exposure-subtype CBT, but all subtypes of CBT have been found to be equally effective

- Pharmacologic therapy is primarily based on the use of SSRIs for treatment and preventing relapse

## Prazosin for PTSD & Alcohol Dependence (Simpson et al. 2015 .red[<sup>5</sup>])
]
.right-column[
- Relatively little evidence is present to suggest any novel treatment for comorbid PTSD and alcohol use disorder

- The adrenergic system is implicated in both PTSD and alcohol use disorder;
  - Elevated sensitivity to the norepinephrine in the CNS is hypothesized as part of the pathophysiology of PTSD
  - Alcohol withdrawal results in an elevated level of norepinephrine, which is responsible for the rewarding effects of alcohol on the brain

.left-column[
## Prazosin for PTSD & Alcohol Dependence (Simpson et al. 2015 .red[<sup>5</sup>])
]
.right-column[
- Currently, prazosin is used to treat patients with PTSD suffering from nightmares, decreasing the amount of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the CNS during sleep, thus providing some relief

- Simpson et al. hypothesized that the use of prazosin in patients with comorbid PTSD and alcohol use disorder could potentially improve both PTSD and alcohol use disorder outcomes when compared to placebo
]
---
.left-column[
## Prazosin for PTSD & Alcohol Dependence (Simpson et al. 2015 .red[<sup>5</sup>])
]
.right-column[
- Pilot double blind RCT studying the effects of prazosin vs. placebo

- Primary outcomes:
  - Self-reported drinking days per week
  - Self-reported heavy drinking days per week (>5 drinks/day for men, >4 drinks/day for women)

- Secondary outcomes:
  - PTSD symptomatology, including total symptoms, re-experiencing trauma, avoidance/numbing, hypervigilance, and a single, recurrent dream item

.left-column[
## Prazosin for PTSD & Alcohol Dependence (Simpson et al. 2015 .red[<sup>5</sup>])
]
.right-column[
- Prazosin provided a signiﬁcant beneﬁt vs. placebo for percent drinking days per week, percent heavy drinking days per week, and number of drinks consumed per week

- Prazosin did **not** significantly reduce PTSD symptomatology, which was unexpected given previous studies on the use of prazosin for patients with PTSD
  - Patients in this study were not exposed to a robust behavioral treatment approach, which may account for the lack of effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment alone in these patients
